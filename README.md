# Lone Wolf Wraps — Single-file site (polished)

Includes:
- `index.html` — optimized for conversions; Calendly embed; Formspree wired with inline success UI; image fallbacks; trust row; process; testimonials; sticky mobile CTA.
- `robots.txt` & `sitemap.xml` — set for https://lonewolfwraps.vercel.app
- `images/logo.png` — placeholder logo; replace with your real one later

## Deploy
Upload **all files** to your GitHub repo root (not inside a subfolder) and commit to main. Vercel will redeploy automatically.

## Edit quick things

- Formspree endpoint: `https://formspree.io/f/mgvzreva` (used by both forms)
